# 🏷️ Online Auction Platform (JSP Group Project)

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a **web-based Online Auction Platform** developed using **JavaServer Pages (JSP)** as part of our **2.2 semester group project**. The system provides a secure and interactive environment for conducting online auctions while demonstrating core concepts of **server-side web development** using Java technologies.

The platform supports multiple user roles, allowing sellers to list items, users to place bids, and administrators to manage users and inquiries. The system automatically determines the **highest bid as the winning bid**, ensuring transparency and fairness.
